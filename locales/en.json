    "description": "This I3S lab internship project explores constraint programming applied to Nonograms: generation, Regular & Ternary solver models, and performance analysis across size, density, and structure.",
    "details": "The platform generates both controlled random grids (density 0.1 to 0.9) and image-derived Nonograms, extracts constraints automatically, and feeds two Choco-Solver models (Regular via automaton and Ternary via elemental transitions).",
    "conclusion": "Analysis shows image-based Nonograms are more structured and easier, the Ternary model excels on small random grids, while the Regular model remains efficient up to 200×200 puzzles.",
    "generation": "Random generation with density control, automatic block extraction, and conversion of images into binary grids.",
    "resolution": "Two Choco-Solver solvers: Regular ensures sequences via finite automaton, Ternary breaks constraints into elemental transitions.",
    "analysis": "Study on grid-size/density impact (intermediate densities hardest) plus solver comparison across diverse structures.",
    "learnings": "Nonograms are NP-hard, runtimes grow quickly, generation may lack uniqueness, and structured puzzles are easier to solve."
